# Java for Testers Journey

This repository documents my Java learning journey, starting from the
fundamentals and progressing toward test automation and SDET-level skills.

I'll be focusing on writing clear, maintainable Java code with a testing mindset,
using small, incremental exercises and practical examples.

## Goals
- Learn Java from the ground up
- Apply Java concepts in a testing context
- Build a solid foundation for API Test Automation
- Develop habits aligned with SDET roles

## Repository Structure
- exercises/ – Java exercises organised by week and topic

## Current Progress
- Week 01: Java basics, conditions, loops, and simple domain modelling

## Status
Work in progress – updated continuously as learning progresses.
